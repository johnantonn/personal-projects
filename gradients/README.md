# Gradients
Showcasing the power of gradient learning

### Summary
This notebook contains a series of experiments conducted using a simple `Perceptron` model and a small variety of 2D datasets to illustrate the power of the gradient information when attributed at the example level.

This information can basically determine the importance (or, contribution) of each training example to the learning process.

### How to
Open `Gradients.ipynb` and explore its contents.
